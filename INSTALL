Right now genesis will only work on Linux systems. In the future we plan on supporting Mac OS as well. 

Step 1. Install `golang`

Step 2. Install `docker`

Step 3. Clone the repository



Step 7. (Optional) For full functionality, give this user sudo access without a password. For example, if you are using the user `wb`, then
    add the line `wb ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL` to your `/etc/sudoers` file. You can do this by running the `visudo` command as root.



Step 10. Run `go get` to install the dependencies of genesis

Step 11. Run `go build` to compile it.

Step 12. Run genesis, preferably in the background, as it is a daemon process.

Step 13. Interact with Genesis via its REST interface. You may get a warning about having to use a default value, this is fairly normal, and is just a safe guard in case you wanted to set that variable. 

Step 14.


Example Build 
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/testnets/ -d '{ \
    "servers":[1],\
    "blockchain":"geth", \
    "nodes":3,\
    "images":["gcr.io/whiteblock/geth:master"],\
    "resources":[{ \
        "cpus":"", \ 
        "memory":"" \
    }], \
    "params":{ \
        "networkId":15468, \
        "difficulty":100000, \ 
        "initBalance":"100000000000000000000", \
        "maxPeers":1000, \
        "gasLimit":4000000, \ 
        "homesteadBlock":0, \
        "eip155Block":10, \
        "eip158Block":10 \
    } \
}'
```
